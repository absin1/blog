Over the past decade there has been an immense movement to inside sales as a dominant model. Sales reps in SaaS companies are now wholly engaged in this model. We are thinking about enabling inside sales agents in ways that help them achieve their maximum potential.

We believe that objection handling is one of the crucial skills that enables a fuitful sales conversation. With this vision we are creating a tool where the tried and tested methods of a successful sales agent can be shared amongst the cohort.

Armed with best practices your sales agents are now improving as they are talking to more prospects. Gone are the days when you had to review sales conversations to find out where an agent is going wrong. You can let the accumulated conversational wealth that you already posses do all this for you.

And if at any point you feel that the accumulated successful conversational wealth isn't enough we provide hooks to take things into your hands so to speak. Not to mention we also know what your agents are selling by hooking into your knowledge sources.

Additionally we also know who they are trying to sell to by peeking into your CRM to find out more information on the prospect. We let you define customer personas which can then be put into play. Imagine your sales agents getting the right cues when they are talking to a Vice President against when they are talking to a Floor Manager. Your agents now know what features of your product makes sense to which customer personas.

Not to mention all of this comes with automatic updates and integration of various productivity softwares your inside sales agents might be using.
